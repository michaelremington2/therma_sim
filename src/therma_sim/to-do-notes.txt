### Main To Do 
- make a movement function
    - Read these papers
        - https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-024-00507-4
        - https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_journals/2020/rmrs_2020_diniz_m001.pdf
        - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93387-2
    - Need to set up von mises/ b line distribution for kangaroo rats
- Make utility functions
- seed patches
- cycle csv for multiple years?
- Apply to jobs
- Finish Biopython workshop
- Make Dashboard of current model
    - https://plotly.com/examples/
- If thermal_db is None:
    Simulate ts for

# Model
- TO DO!!!! Add checks that for pop count > 0
- add birth rates
- check yearly data to make sure its full year
    - Yearly data is not a full year. Check with ryan if there is new data.
- work time of day and date into data

# Croalatus viridis pop size look through literature # 2.4 to 16.9 snakes per hectare
- 150 snakes per den, moving occupy a space 5000 hectares
- 1 snake per 5 hectares

- holes and shrubs for thermo refugia 
- time at night for thermal active positions
- Active season burrow
- Any given night they are active 3 hours a night for k rats
    - 

- 2 -3 liters per year for ords
- 2 new snake babies on average

- Maybe think of simulating multiple years
- look up birthd rates for snakes and krats in literature


# General probability of a snake and a kangaroo rat coming into contact



texas: 3 squarekalometers 150 1 snake per every 3 hectares
Nebraska: 

Maybe treat pop size as equal

Potentially look at croatlus oreganus


- population estimates for ordaii 7- 10 per hectare
# 

# Utility
- Thermoregulate
    - calculate de 
    - low values of de = low values of utility for the need to thermorgulate
- forage
    - Values of metabolic state being close to zero 
- rest
    - maybe keep constant?

# metabolism


# rattlesnakes

- Maybe even do an on or off day
- Potentially a daily active time
- Background death rate
- Admixture rate

# kangaroo rats
- Admixture rate


# Utility functions
- maybe make a utility function script class


#### Random thoughts
- think about a nested sub game. rest vs active, if active, thermorgulate or forage
- time dependend sub game
