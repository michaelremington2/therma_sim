### Main To Do 
1) BUild a continuous movement class
    - Rethank scale
    32 x 32 hectares
    - make a movement function
    - get neighbors
    - initial positions
        - 1 snake per about 2 hectares
        - 10 28 kangaroo rats per hectare
    - temperature will just be open and burrow 
    - change language from open and burrow to thermal refuge and open
2) set individuals per hectare to be a lot lower
3) Add in birth model
4) Research pop sizes and birth rates
5) Look at foraging models again



# Model
- TO DO!!!! Add checks that for pop count > 0
- add birth rates
- admixture rate (stepping stone model)
- check yearly data to make sure its full year
    - Yearly data is not a full year. Check with ryan if there is new data.
- work time of day and date into data

# Croalatus viridis pop size look through literature # 2.4 to 16.9 snakes per hectare
- 150 snakes per den, moving occupy a space 5000 hectares
- 1 snake per 5 hectares

- holes and shrubs for thermo refugia 
- time at night for thermal active positions
- Active season burrow
- Any given night they are active 3 hours a night for k rats
    - 

- 2 -3 liters per year for ords
- 2 new snake babies on average

- Maybe think of simulating multiple years
- look up birthd rates for snakes and krats in literature


# General probability of a snake and a kangaroo rat coming into contact



texas: 3 squarekalometers 150 1 snake per every 3 hectares
Nebraska: 

Maybe treat pop size as equal

Potentially look at croatlus oreganus


- population estimates for ordaii 7- 10 per hectare
# 

# Utility
- Thermoregulate
    - calculate de 
    - low values of de = low values of utility for the need to thermorgulate
- forage
    - Values of metabolic state being close to zero 
- rest
    - maybe keep constant?

# metabolism


# rattlesnakes

- Maybe even do an on or off day
- Potentially a daily active time
- Background death rate
- Admixture rate

# kangaroo rats
- Admixture rate


# Utility functions
- maybe make a utility function script class


#### Random thoughts
- think about a nested sub game. rest vs active, if active, thermorgulate or forage
- time dependend sub game
