## Introduction

This document describes the `EctothermMetabolism` class, a simulation component modeling energy dynamics in ectothermic organisms based on mass, temperature, and activity level. It is used in agent-based ecological simulations to track the metabolic state of individuals over time.

Ectotherms regulate their body temperature behaviorally. Their metabolic rate is highly dependent on both body mass and body temperature. This module integrates:

- **Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR)** scaling with mass and temperature.
- **Energy expenditure** from resting or foraging behaviors.
- **Energy intake** from prey consumption.
- A **Metabolic state** variable representing internal energy reserves, bounded by a maximum based on expected meal size and caloric yield.

## Metabolic State Initialization

Each organism is initialized with a metabolic state sampled from a user-defined range, single value, or tuple. The maximum metabolic state is computed as:

$$
\text{Max}_M = m_{\text{max}} \times C_{\text{g}} \times M_{\text{prey}}
$$

Where:

- $m_{\text{max}}$: maximum meals stored
- $C_{\text{g}}$: calories per gram of prey
- $M_{\text{prey}}$: expected prey mass

## SMR Equation

Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR), a proxy for $\dot{V}O_2$, is computed as a log-linear function of body mass and temperature:

$$
\log_{10}(\text{SMR}) = X_1 \cdot \log_{10}(M) + X_2 \cdot T + X_3
$$

This equation was derived from (https://doi.org/10.1643/CP-03-074R1) and coefficents were set based off this paper.
where:

- $M$: body mass (g)
- $T$: body temperature (Â°C)
- $X_1, X_2, X_3$: empirically derived coefficients

The SMR is then exponentiated:

$$
\text{SMR} = 10^{\log_{10}(\text{SMR})}
$$

## Energy Expenditure

Hourly energy expenditure is scaled by an **activity coefficient** (1 for resting, 2 for active behaviors):
When the activity coeeffiecent is 1, the organism is under a SMR energy expendeture profile. When the activity profile is 2, the organism is in AMR.

$$
\text{Energy} = \text{SMR} \times \alpha \times \text{conversion constants}
$$

- $\alpha$: activity multiplier (e.g., 2 for foraging)
- Conversion factors:
  - $1\ \text{mL O}_2 = 19.874\ \text{J}$
  - $1\ \text{J} = 2.39 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{Calories}$

## Energy Intake from Prey

Caloric gain from consuming prey is:

$$
E_{\text{gain}} = M_{\text{prey}} \times C_{\text{g}} \times \eta
$$

Where:

- $C_{\text{g}}$: calories per gram of prey
- $\eta$: digestion efficiency

## Conclusion
If an organisms metabolic state reaches $0$, they die due to starvation and are removed from the simulation.
